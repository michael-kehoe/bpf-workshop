2. Try writing your own eBPF program with the 'sys_sync' (Lesson 2) example [here](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/docs/tutorial_bcc_python_developer.md#lesson-2-sys_sync)

### Tutorial 2: Going deeper
1. Try the Python 'bitehist' (Lesson 9) example [here](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/docs/tutorial_bcc_python_developer.md#lesson-9-bitehistpy)
2. Now it's time to try writing your own tool, try the 'disklatency' (Lesson 10) tutorial [here](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/docs/tutorial_bcc_python_developer.md#lesson-10-disklatencypy)
